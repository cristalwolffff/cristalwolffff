### Hi there! I'm an AI Engineer & Creative Technologist. 👋

I sit at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Automation**, and **Visual Strategy**.
With a background in high-level Design and a pivot to Software Engineering, I don't just build systems that work—I build solutions that align with brand identity and business goals.

I am a **Salesforce Certified AI Associate** focused on practical, revenue-driving implementations.
